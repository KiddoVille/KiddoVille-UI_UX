### MVC Architecture
The system follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

- **Models**: Represented by the `Modals` directory, containing data structures and database interactions
- **Views**: User interface templates in the `Views` directory, organized by user role
- **Controllers**: Request handling logic in the `Controllers` directory, separated by functionality

### Frontend
- Modern responsive web interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Quail.js for frontend data binding and reactivity
- AJAX for asynchronous data loading
- Bootstrap for responsive design components
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and events

### Backend
- PHP 8.1+ for server-side processing
- Custom MVC framework with core components in the `core` directory
- RESTful API architecture for service integrations
- Session-based authentication with secure cookie management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for permissions

### Database
- MySQL 8.0+ relational database for structured data storage
- Optimized schema with proper indexing for fast queries
- Database triggers for maintaining data integrity
- Stored procedures for complex data operations
- Archive tables for historical data management

### Integrations
- **PHPMailer**: For sending customized emails and notifications
- **WhatsApp API**: For parent notifications and quick communications
- **SMS API**: For urgent alerts and reminders
