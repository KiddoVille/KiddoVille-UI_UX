To implement a comprehensive inventory management system for your daycare, you'll need to design a set of web pages that allow all roles (manager, teachers, receptionist) to interact with the inventory seamlessly. Below is a list of the key web pages and forms you might need for each user type:

1. Manager Pages:
Dashboard (Manager's Home Page):
Overview of the entire inventory (e.g., current stock, items issued, items returned, restocking status, etc.).
Quick links to common tasks such as viewing reports, adding new items, and managing stock.
Inventory Management Page:
Table of Inventory: Displays all items in the system, with columns like item name, category, quantity in stock, and status (available/used/ordered for restock).
Action Buttons: Options to add new items, edit existing items, and delete items.
Inventory Usage Report:
Table of Usage: Shows details of items issued (to teachers, etc.), the quantity taken, and who took them.
Form to View Usage History: Filter by date, teacher, item category, etc., to track usage patterns.
Restocking Page:
Table of Low Stock Items: Alerts or highlights items that need to be restocked based on inventory levels.
Form to Restock Items: Option to input restocking quantities and update stock.
2. Teacher Pages:
A summary of their own usage of items (e.g., what they have taken, if it's still in use, and if it needs to be returned).
Alerts about low stock or items that they have requested but are not available.
Inventory Checkout Page (for Teachers):
Item List with Checkout Option: Teachers can select from a list of available items, mark the quantity they are taking, and confirm.
Mark as Taken: Button to mark an item as taken and add a note if it's for a specific use.
